# This repository is no longer maintained
Because of me focussing on new projects I have stopped updating this project.<br>
**It no longer works with the Discord API changes (November 2020) and needs major changes in Order to update to Discord.JS 12 or higher**

### However - The only module I developed for this project is still maintained!
If you want to use the "Accept-Rules" Module [head to this repository](https://github.com/AstroGD/discord-accept-rules-bot) and install it.

You can also develop own modules for my mainframe if you want but you need to download the "Accept-Rules"-Module to get the latest Version of my Mainframe.
If you've created a module make sure to reach out to me - Maybe I will get back to supporting this repository and add your Module to check modules_list.md

# Discord Bot Mainframe
A Modular Discord Bot System where everyone can create their own modules and easily insert them into the Bot

## Installation
- Edit config/config.json and insert your Discord Bot User Token [Here's an explanation of how to create a Discord Bot Account](https://medium.com/@gregjwww/how-to-build-a-discord-bot-6c5b612c651).

## Usage

To start the Bot you need [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/) installed on your Device. Then open a command prompt in the folder, you've installed the Mainframe to and type `npm start`.

The Bot should now start. After finishing the initialization you can type `help` and press enter to get a list of available commands.

## Modules
Without Modules the Bot will not do anything. For a list of available modules check modules_list.md in the repository.
Also feel free to create your own modules and contact me to get them onto the modules list.

For a guide on how to install a module, check the readme.md or wiki of the module you want to install.
I do not take any responsibility for modified versions of my mainframe or unlisted modules.
